# sfc-pk-gfc-model
Post-Keynesian Stock-Flow Consistent Model of GFC
These models run under OpenModelica https://github.com/OpenModelica also see https://openmodelica.org/
EconomicModels.mo which is an OMEdit file contains the same model as LongTermGrowth.onb SfcModelOfGfc.onb (OMNotebook)
OMEdit is much more convenient for modelling but graphs cannot be defined there
In order to get reasonable graphs, export them from OMNotebook as pdf or manually export them from OMEdit
It is also possible to export the data as .csv and use gnuplot but this requires extracting columns from the output file
