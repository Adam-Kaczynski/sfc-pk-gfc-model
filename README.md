# sfc-pk-gfc-model
Post-Keynesian Stock-Flow Consistent Model of the GFC.

Once the thesis which is related to the model is examined, it will be placed in this directory. The document contains detailed description of the content of the model and information about the simulated scenarios.

These models run under OpenModelica https://github.com/OpenModelica also see https://openmodelica.org/
EconomicModels.mo which is an OMEdit file contains the same model as LongTermGrowth.onb SfcModelOfGfc.onb (OMNotebook)
OMEdit is much more convenient for modelling but graphs cannot be defined there.
In order to get reasonable graphs, export them from OMNotebook as pdf or manually export them from OMEdit.
It is also possible to export the data as .csv and use gnuplot but this requires extracting columns from the output file.
